ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* CleanSpec.mk
* MODULE_LICENSE_APACHE2
* NOTICE
* lib/
* lib/Android.mk
* lib/com/
* lib/com/android/
* lib/com/android/inputmethod/
* lib/com/android/inputmethod/pinyin/
* lib/com/android/inputmethod/pinyin/IPinyinDecoderService.aidl
* lib/eventbus-3.0.0.jar
* proguard.cfg
* proguard.flags

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => mstar_ime/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => mstar_ime/src/main/jni/
* res/ => mstar_ime/src/main/res/
* src/ => mstar_ime/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
